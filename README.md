# This is Portfolio Manager, a website for keeping track of personal stocks. 

This program pulls live stock data using an API (worldtradingdata.com), and allows the user to add, view, or delete stocks. The front end (this repo) is built on React. The back end is built on ASP.NET Core. 

Here's the link to the back end: https://github.com/acesadaf/portfolio-manager-backend

Here are a few screenshots from the app.
